          Hello! My name is Kushal and I enjoy developing websites. My interest
          in web development started back in 2020 when I stumbled across a few
          YouTube videos to and web development courses. Fast-forward to today,
          and Iâ€™ve completed a number of small applications. My main focus right
          now is being a successful freelancer in the given field while also
          pursuing Data Science as my main line of work.
